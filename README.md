# Transformative technology leader
I've joined the cause, the fight to better our world with code. </br>
Even though many industries are rapidly changing, a few lag behind. 
My eyes are set on reshaping education. ðŸŽ“

Here on the page you'll find snippets of what projects I'm working on.
No doubt I'll be testing how to change education from a variety of different technologies. 
Anything from chrome-extensions to VR, I'm open to everything as long as it pushes humanity to learn better and faster.
If you're into the concept and feel like you can help out, contact me anywhere on my socials. ðŸ“¨
